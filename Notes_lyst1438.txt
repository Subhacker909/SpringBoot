=> What is Spring :-
	-> Spring is an "Open Source Application Framework" which is used to develop any type of application i.e. Standalone or Enterprise application
	-> Spring framework was developed by Rod Johnson
	-> Spring framework was released under Apache 1.0 licence
	-> Spring framework was released in June 2003
	-> First production version i.e. 1.0 was released in March 2004
	-> Latest version is 6.x version


=> Advantages of Spring Framework :-
	-> Dependency Injection
	-> Support AOP (Aspect Oriented Programming)
	-> Easily integrated with other frameworks
	-> Highly scalable and maintanable
	-> Easy to test the application
	    etc


=> What is Spring Container :-
	-> Spring container is the "Heart" or "Core component" of spring framework
	-> We can compare it like JVM (which is Heart or Core Component) in core java
	-> Responsibilities of spring container :-
		1. Instantiate bean object
		2. Configure bean object
		3. Initialize bean object
		4. Destroy bean object
		5. Manage bean object life cycle
		6. Dependency Injection
		7. Supports AOP
		8. Supports I18N
		9. Resource Management
		    etc
	-> Working of Spring Container :-
		= Diagram

	-> There are 2 types of Spring Container :-
		1. BeanFactory (old)
		2. ApplicationContext (new)
	-> NOTE : For spring containers we have to provide jar files or dependencies

	-> Hierarchy of Spring Containers :-

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=> What is BeanFactory ?
	-> It is the core component or heart that instantiate, configure, initialize, destroy manage bean objects life cycle etc
	-> It is the core interface in spring framework for managing and accessing bean objects

=> What is ApplicationContext ?
	-> It is sub-interface of BeanFactory for managing and accessing bean objects
	-> It serves as a "Spring Container" which provides more functionalities as compared to BeanFactory
	-> In simple terms we can say that it is an advanced spring container as compared to BeanFactory

=> What is difference between BeanFactory and ApplicationContext ?
	1. BeanFactory is the core container or fundamental container
	    ApplicationContext is an advanced spring container which provides all the facilities of BeanFactory container

	2. BeanFactory creates the bean objects when we call getBean(-) method and thus it is known as lazy-instantiation
	    ApplicationContext creates the bean objects when the container gets started and thus it is known as eager-instantiation

	3. BeanFactory is suitable for Standalone applications
	    ApplicationContext is suitable for Enterprise applications

	4. BeanFactory supports only singleton and prototype scope
	    ApplicationContext supports singleton, prototype, request, session scopes

	5. BeanFactory does not support AOPand ORM
	    ApplicationContext support AOP and ORM

	6. BeanFactory does not support I18N functionality
	    ApplicationContext support I18N functionality

	7. BeanFactory does not support annotations
	    ApplicationContext support annotations

	    etc

=> What is spring configuration file ?
	-> It is a file which is used to provide the configurations or settings or instructions to the spring container
	-> There are a lot of configurations which are as follows :-
		1. Bean definations
		2. Bean Lifecycle
		3. Dependency Injection
		4. Bean Autowiring
		5. Database configurations
		6. View Resolvers
		7. Security configurations
		8. AOP configurations
		9. Component scanning
		    etc
	-> We can provide spring configurations by following :-
		1. XML file
		2. Java classes
		3. Annotations
		4. Property files
		5. Environment variables
		    etc

	-> NOTE : If we create XML configuration file then its standard name is applicationContext.xml
