=> Steps to create Hibernate First Program :-
	1. Download & Install any one IDE (Eclipse)
	2. Create Simple Java Project or Maven Project
	3. Add hibernate jars or provide dependencies
	4. Create "POJO" class
	5. Create Hibernate Mapping File
	6. Create Hibernate Configuration File
	7. Create main class to execute hibernate application with following steps :-
		7.1 Create Configuration class object
			-> The configuration class is used to configure and manage hibernate settings
			-> How to get Configuration object :-
				** Configuration cfg = new Configuration();
			-> Method of Configuration class :-
				** configure()	//It is used to load the hibernate configuration details from an external file

		7.2 Create SessionFactory object :-
			-> SessionFactory is an interface that represents a factory for creating "Session" objects
			-> It is used to load the configuration details from configuration file, setting up connection pool, manage database connection etc
			-> How to get SessionFactory object :-
				** SessionFactory sessionFactory = cfg.buildSessionFactory();

		7.3 Create "Session" object :-
			-> Session is an interface that represents a single unit of work
			-> It is used to perform database operations
			-> How to get Session object ?
				** Session session = sessionFactory.openSession();
			-> Now we will perform database operations with Session object :-
				a. Insert operation
					= save()
					= persist()
				b. Update operation
					= update()
					= saveOrUpdate()
				c. Delete operation
					= delete()
				d. Retrieve operation
					= get()
					= load()

		7.4 Create Transaction Object :-
			-> Transaction is an interface that represents database transactions
			-> It is used to control and manage transactions
			-> How to get Transaction object :-
				** Transaction transaction = session.getTransaction();
				   transaction.begin();
				** Transaction transaction = session.beginTransaction();

			-> NOTE : In JDBC, AutoCommit default value is "true" and we have to set it to false by con.setAutoCommit("false"); but in hibernate default AutCommit is "false"
