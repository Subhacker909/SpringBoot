=> Logging :-
	-> Logging is the process of tracking or recording important information, events, messages or issues that occur during the execution of our application
	-> The log files generated during the logging process will help the developers or system administrator to monitor the application behaviour
	
	-> Use of logging :-
		1. Error Tracking and Debugging :-
			= In web applications we can track the error for eg submitting the form
		2. Security Monitoring :-
			= We can track security-related events such as failed to login attempts or unauthorized login access
		3. Auditing and Compliance :-
			= A finanicial application might log all the financial transactions including the details of transaction, its time, location etc
		4. Performce Analysis :-
			= We can track the time taken by our application to perform any event or response
		5. System Health Monitoring :-
			= In server enviroment we can track the memory usage, CPU load and other metrics
		6. Deployment and Release Monitoring :-
			= We can track the version number, time of releasing the application etc
		    etc

	-> Where we can use logging :-
		1. Software Development
			= Web Development
			= Mobile App Development
		2. Devops and Infrastructure
			= Server Applications
			= Databases
		3. Networking and Security :-
			= Firewall and Security Application
			= Network Servers
		4. Cloud Computing :-
			= Cloud Services
			= Serverless computing
		    etc

	-> Logging is supported by multiple langauges i.e. java, php, python, node js etc

	-> There are a lot of API's and Frameworks for logging :-
		1. Java Logging API
		2. Log4j
		3. Logback
		4. Tinylog

		5. SLF4j
		6. JCL (Jakarta Commons Logging)
		    (5th and 6th are logging wrappers)

=> Java Logging API :-
	-> Java Logging API was introduced in JDK 1.4 version
	-> It is pre-defined in JDK so we dont need to download or add any dependency or jar file
	-> This API is present in "java.util.logging" package
	-> Working of logging :-
		=
	-> Components of Logging :-
		= There are 2 main components of logging :-
			1. Logger
			2. Handler

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

=> Logger :-
	-> Logger is an object in logging framework that we use to emit the log messages
	-> Some levels of Logger are :-
		1. SEVERE (highest value)
		2. WARNING
		3. INFO
		4. CONFIG
		5. FINE
		6. FINER
		7. FINEST (lowest value)

=> Handler :-
	-> Handler will take the messages and post it to the provided medium like console or database or file etc
	-> There are 5 handlers :-
		1. ConsoleHandler
		2. FileHandler
		3. StreamHandler
		4. SocketHandler
		5. MemoryHandler

	-> Handler is an object that listens the messages at or above a specified minimum security level
