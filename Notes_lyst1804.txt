=> JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) :-
	-> JDBC is a technology which is used to interact the java application with database
	
	-> JDBC is also an API (packages, interfaces and classes)
		= There are 2 main packages in JDBC API :-
			1. "java.sql" package :
				>> Driver (interface)
				>> Connection (interface)
				>> Statement (interface)
				>> PreparedStatement (interface)
				>> CallableStatement (interface)
				>> ResultSet (interface)
				>> DriverManager (class)
				>> Date (class)
				>> Time (class)
				     etc
			2. "javax.sql" package :
				>> DataSource (interface)
				>> RowSet (interface)
				>> RowSetListener (interface)
				>> ConnectionEventListener (interface)
				>> RowSetEvent (class)
				>> ConnectionEvent (class)
				     etc

	-> NOTE : JDBC is an abstraction which is provided by Sun Microsystems and implemented by database vendors (and provide them in the form of jar files)

	-> Working of JDBC :-
		= Diagram

	-> Components of JDBC :-
		= Driver (Translator) :-
			>> It is used to convert the java calls to database specific calls and database specific calls to java calls
		= Connection (Road) :-
			>> It is used to create conneciton between java application and database
		= Statement / PreparedStatement / CallableStatement (Truck) :-
			>> It is used to send the SQL queries (with data) from java application to database and get the result
		= ResultSet (Box)
			>> It is used to store the output from database

	-> Steps to create database connection in java :-
		1. Load and Register driver
			= Class.forName("driver class name");
		2. Establish the connection between java application and database :-
			= DriverManager.getConnection("url", "username", "password");
