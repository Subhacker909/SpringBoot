=> JavaScript :-
	-> JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic programming language used primarily for creating interactive web pages and applications.
	-> It supports both client-side ---scripting langauge--- and server-side development ---using NodeJS.
	
	-> JavaScript was created by Brendan Eich at Netscape in 1995. Initially named "LiveScript," it was renamed to capitalize on Java's popularity at the time.
	
	-> Features of JavaScript:
		1. JavaScript is a lightweight and -interpreted language.
		2. Almost all browsers support JavaScript.
		3. JavaScript is a case-sensitive language.
		4. JavaScript follows the syntax and structure similar to C programming language, making it a structured programming language.
		5. JavaScript is an object-oriented programming language where objects inherit properties and methods directly from other objects rather than from classes.
		
	-> Use of JavaScript:
		1. Web Development:
			= Creating dynamic and interactive web pages.
		2. Web Applications:
			= Developing complex web applications, including single-page applications (SPAs).
		3. Server-Side Applications:
			= Using Node.js to build scalable network applications.
		4. Mobile Applications:
			= Using frameworks like React Native to develop cross-platform mobile applications.
		5. Game Development:
			= Creating browser-based games.
		6. Desktop Applications:
			= Developing desktop applications using frameworks like Electron.
	-> NOTE :-
		= At present we use javascript only for web development:
			>> Pop-up Windows
			>> Animations
				- Animation sliders
				- Zoom effects
				- Animated galleries
			>> Form Validations
			>> Charts and Graphs
			>> Calendar and Date/Time Pickers
			>> Drop-down Menus
			>> Maps
			>> Audio and Video Players
			
	-> Types Of JavaScript :
		1. Internal JavaScript
			= <script> javascript_code </script> (can be used in head and body tag)
		2. External JavaScript
			= <script src="path"></script>
			>> It seprates the code of HTML and JS
			>> It increases readability and mentainability
			
	-> Variables in JavaScript :
		1. var (this we will use)
		2. let
		3. const
	-> How to write variable name ?
		= Correct ways ---- rollno, roll_no, roll-no, rollNo, rollno1
		= Wrong way ---- roll no, 1rollno, roll+no

	-> Data Types in JavaScript :
		1. var a=10; - number
		2. var a=true; - boolean
		3. var a="hello"; - string
		4. var a='hello' - string
		5. var a=["deepak", "amit", "rahul"] - object
		6. var a={name : "deepak", rollno : 101}; - object
		7. var a=null; - object
		8. var a; - undefined

	-> JavaScript Operators : 
		1. Arithmetic Operators (+,-,*,/,%)
		2. Assignment Operators (=, +=, -=, *=, /=, %=)
		3. Comparison Operators (==, !=, ===, !==, >, <, >=, <=)
		4. Logical Operators (&&, ||, !)
		5. Bitwise Operators (&, |, ^, ~, <<, >>)
		6. Type Operators (typeOf, instanceOf)

	-> JavaScript Control Statements : 
		1. Selection Statements - if, if-else, if-else if, nested if, switch
		2. Looping Statements - for, while, do-while, for-in
		3. Break Statement - break, continue, return

	-> JavaScript provides a lot of Objects but mostly we use 2 main objects as below:
		1. window
		2. document
	
--------------------------------------------

1. "window" Object (Part of BOM - Browser Object Model):
	= Represents the browser window or tab that contains the web page.
	= Provides properties and methods for interacting with the browser environment.
	= Methods of window object are:
		- alert(message)
		- confirm(message)
		- prompt(message, defaultText)
		- open(url, target, features)
		etc
2. "document" (Part of DOM - Document Object Model):
	= Represents the HTML document loaded in the browser window.
	= Provides properties and methods for accessing and manipulating the content, structure, and style of the document.
	= Methods of document object are:
		------write()
		- getElementById(id)
		- getElementsByClassName(className)
		- createElement(tagName)
		- getAttribute(name)
		- setAttribute(name, value)
		etc
