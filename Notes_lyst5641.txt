=> Points to remember :-
	1. We can remove the getter methods if the properties are not used outside the bean class
	2. We cannot remove setter methods because property tag in xml file internally calls the setter methods
	

=> What is id and name attribute :-
	-> id : It specifies the unique identity of the bean object

	-> name :-
		= It specifies the unique identity bean object name but it is more flexible as compared to id attribute
		= Following are the flexibilities :-
			1. We can provide multiple names for one bean object
			2. We can separate the multiple bean object names by comma, semi-colan or space
			3. We can provide same bean object name in name and id attribute
