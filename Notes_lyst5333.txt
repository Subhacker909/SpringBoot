=> Spring Boot JDBC Module :-
	-> Spring Boot with JDBC provides a streamlined way to connect to Spring Boot application with JDBC and execute SQL queries
	-> For spring boot JDBC applications, we have to include one dependency i.e. "spring-boot-starter-jdbc"
	-> Some important interfaces and classes provides by "spring-boot-starter-jdbc" are :-
		1. DataSource <interface>
		2. JdbcTemplate <class>
		3. NamedParameterJdbcTemplate <class>
		    etc
	-> NOTE :-
		= Spring Boot JDBC is built upon Spring JDBC and simplifies database operations in spring boot applications
		= Spring Boot auto-configures DataSource and JdbcTemplate beans, reducing manual configurations

--------------------------------------------------

=> DataSource :-
	-> It is an interface which is present in "javax.sql" package
	-> It provides connections to the database and manages the connection pooling
	-> In Spring boot, DataSource is auto-configured by default based on the application properties
	-> DataSource configures properties automatically but it can be customized in the application.properties or application.yml file

--------------------------------------------------

=> JdbcTemplate :-
	-> It is a central class for JDBC operations in spring boot
	-> It is used for :-
		1. Simlifies JDBC :-
			= JdbcTemplate reduces boilerplate JDBC code making it readable and concise
		2. Connection Management :-
			= It manages connections, reducing the need for manual connection handling
		3. Exception handling :-
			= Automatically translates the database exceptions into spring's DataAccessExceptions which simplifies the error handling
		4. SQL executions :-
			= Executes SQL queries i.e. insert, update, delete, select etc
		5. Parametrization :-
			= Support both positional and named parameters in SQL queires
		6. Batch updations :-
			= JdbcTemplate provides methods for batch updates, improving performance for bulk data operations
		etc
	-> Methods of JdbcTemplate :-
		1. update(-)
			= used for insert, update and delete SQL queries
		2. query(-)
		    queryForList(-)
		    queryForMap(-)
		    queryForObject(-) 
		    queryForRowSet(-)
		    etc
			= used for select operations
		3. execute(-)
			= used for DDL (create, drop, alter etc) sql queries
