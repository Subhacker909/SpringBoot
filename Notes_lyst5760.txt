		= Transaction follows the ACID property
			>> A (Atomicity) - Either perform all operations or none
			>> C (Consistency) - The database state must be stable
			>> I (Isolation) - All the transactions must be executed independently, one transaction must not give effect to another transaction
			>> D (Durability) - The changes of successful transaction occurs even if the system/database failure occurs
